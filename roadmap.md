## Implementation Notes

### Phase Approach
1. Each priority level should be substantially complete before moving to the next
2. Features within each priority can be developed in parallel when resources allow
3. Each feature should be tested in isolation before integration
4. User feedback should be gathered after each major feature release

### Development Guidelines
1. Maintain focus on core tracking reliability
2. Ensure scalability of all new features
3. Keep user interface consistent and intuitive
4. Prioritize real-time data accuracy
5. Follow security best practices

### Technical Considerations
1. Optimize database queries for large datasets
2. Implement proper error handling and logging
3. Ensure mobile responsiveness
4. Maintain code documentation
5. Regular performance testing

This roadmap is subject to change based on:
- User feedback and needs
- Technical constraints
- Resource availability
- Market conditions
- Industry regulations
